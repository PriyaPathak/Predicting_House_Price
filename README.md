# Predicting_House_Price
 Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.  With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, the objective is to predict the final price of each home.
